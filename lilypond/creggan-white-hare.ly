  One fine autumn morning, as you may suppose

  The red, golden sun o'er the green mountain rose

  Barney Conway came down and did loudly declare

  \"Today I'll put an end to that Creggan white hare\"

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_three = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 3 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  So he searched through the lowlands and down through the glens

  All among the green rushes where the white hare had dens

  'Til at last, coming over the heather so fair

  From behind a wild thistle, out jumped the white hare

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_four = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 4 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  Well, he gave a great yell, and his dog he slipped, too

  As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew

  But the dogs soon came back, which made poor Barney sigh

  For he knew that the white hare had bid him good-bye

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_five = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 5 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  We're some jolly sportsmen come down from Pom'roy

  From Cookstown, Dungannon, and also the Moy

  With our pedigree greyhounds, we've traveled far far

  And come down to the Creggan in our fine motor car

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_six = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 6 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  So down through the lowlands these huntsmen did go

  To search for the white hare, they tried high and low

  'Til at last, Barney Conway, as he came on its lair

  Shouted out to the huntsmen, \"There lies the white hare\"

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_seven = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 7 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  So they called in their greyhounds from off the green lea

  And Barney and the huntsmen, they jumped high with glee

  And on the bog-bank, they all gethered 'round

  Seven men and nine dogs did our poor hare surround

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_eight = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 8 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  No wonder the poor hare did tremble with fear

  As she stood on her hind legs, she rose her big ears

  She stood on her hind legs, and with one galland spring

  Leapt over the greyhounds and broke through the ring

  "

  \wordwrap-string #"

  Oh the chase, it went on, 'twas a beautiful view

  As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain blew

  But the pedigree greyhounds, they didn't run far

  They came back and went home in their fine motorcar

  "
} % end \markup

creggan_verse_final = \markup {
  \italic{ Verse: 10 }
  \wordwrap-string #"

  And now to conclude and to finish this rhyme

  I hope you'll forgive me for singing all this time

  If there's any amongst you in Carrickmore Fair

  Drink up a good health to the Creggan white hare
